// charAt() always indexes the string as a sequence of UTF-16 code units, so it may return 
// lone surrogates. To get the full Unicode code point at the given index, use
//  String.prototype.codePointAt() and String.fromCodePoint().

//Zero-based index of the character to be returned. Converted to an integer â€” undefined is converted to 0.
